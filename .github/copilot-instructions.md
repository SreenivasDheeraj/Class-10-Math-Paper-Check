# AI Agent Instructions for Class-10-Math-Paper-Check

This repository contains code for automatically checking and grading Class 10 Mathematics papers. Here are the key things you need to know to work effectively with this codebase.

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based educational technology project focused on automated assessment of Class 10 Mathematics examination papers. The project appears to be in its initial stages with basic project structure setup.

## Environment Setup

- The project uses Python with standard virtual environment practices
- Dependencies are managed through standard Python package management tools
- Development environment can be set up by creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies (when requirements.txt is added)
- Visual Studio Code is the recommended IDE with support for Jupyter Notebooks
- Please create well defined and documented code for any new features or fixes
- All commits and code changes should follow best practices for Python development and be well-documented and commit names should follow standard naming structures.
- Similar type of commits should follow similar naming conventions and have a number so that we can easily track them.

## Key Patterns & Conventions

Based on the project structure:

1. **Python Best Practices**
   - Following standard Python project structure
   - Using `.gitignore` optimized for Python projects
   - Support for various Python packaging and environment tools (venv, poetry, pdm, etc.)

2. **Development Tools Integration**
   - Visual Studio Code integration
   - Support for Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb_checkpoints` in gitignore)
   - Integration with AI tools like Cursor and Abstra

## Important Directories

Key directories to be aware of:
- Root directory: Main project files
- `.github/`: GitHub specific configurations and documentation
- Future directories for:
  - Source code
  - Tests
  - Documentation
  - Resources
- model_architecture.md: Details on the AI model architecture
- model_notes.md: Notes on model requirements and updates

## Getting Started

For new AI agents working with this codebase:

1. First understand the mathematical assessment requirements and grading criteria
2. Review any test cases and validation approaches
3. Be mindful of educational accuracy and fairness in assessment logic
4. Consider scalability and maintainability in any code additions

## Notes for AI Agents

- This is an educational tool - accuracy and reliability are crucial
- Code should be well-documented and maintainable
- Consider edge cases in mathematical answers
- Follow Python best practices and PEP guidelines
- Remember this handles student data - maintain appropriate data handling practices
- We are looking at Indian Class 10 Math syllabus and exam patterns for reference. We'll train on CBSE Curriculum and exam styles.
- The model architecture and requirements may evolve as the project develops and all details shall be updated on model arhcitecture and model_notes.md in the same directory
